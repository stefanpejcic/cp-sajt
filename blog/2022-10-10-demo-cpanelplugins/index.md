Demo site where users can test free cpanel plugins without needing to setup a cpanel server and installing the plugin.

[demo.cpanelplugins.com](https://demo.cpanelplugins.com/)

Please keep in mind that this is only a PHP application that mimics the look and feel of cpanel, NOT a real cpanel demo. Why? Well, there are two reasons for this: first, cPanel needs a license, and second, this way the demo website doesn't require any maintenance from my end.

Even though cPanel agreed to give me a free development license for hosting my plugins demo (shoutout to cPanel! ), I chose to take a different route.

It is possible to host these demos without a cPanel because cPanel plugins are (usually) written in PHP. You can also publish them as standalone applications or plugins for another hosting panel, such as Aapanel or DirectAdmin.

If you are interested in creating your own cPanel plugin, here are a few places to start: <br><a href="https://pcx3.com/cp/how-to-create-a-cpanel-plugin/" target="_blank">PCx3: How to create a CP plugin</a> | <a href="https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/DD/Guide+to+cPanel+Plugins" target="_blank">cPanel: Guide to cPanel Plugins</a>
